            1988 Graphics Section Poster Session
          Displaying Analysis of Baseball Salaries

     The Statistical Graphics Section of the  American  Sta-
tistical  Association is sponsoring a special poster session
titled "Why They Make What They Make - An Analysis of  Major
League  Baseball  Salaries."   The  session  will be held in
August 1988 at the meetings in New Orleans and  is  intended
to  allow  members  to  compare techniques for analyzing and
displaying data.  The session provides a forum for both  old
and  new  graphical techniques to describe and summarize the
data.

     The results of each analysis will be  displayed  during
the  poster session.  Each participant will be given a space
to display his/her results and  other  conference  attendees
will be encouraged to discuss them with you.  There will not
be any formal discussion or comparison of results.   Rather,
the  opportunity  is  provided for informal comparison among
ourselves.

     Since  this  session  is  treated   as   an   organized
contributed-paper  session,  you  must submit a contributed-
paper abstract to the ASA  office.   The  abstract  must  be
postmarked  not  later than February 15, 1988 AND identified
as a contribution to the special Statistical Graphics  Expo-
sition.   The  forms can be found in future issues of AMSTAT
News.  The abstract can be very  general.   A  sample  which
will  suffice  is  provided below.  Variations might include
the software, hardware and techniques you plan to use.   You
have  until August to work on the analysis.  After the meet-
ings you will be given an opportunity  to  include  a  short
paper  describing  your  analysis in the 1988 Proceedings of
the Statistical Graphics Section.


                      SAMPLE ABSTRACT

             Analysis of Baseball Salary Data *

     This analysis describes and  summarizes  the  relation-
     ships  between  1987  salaries of major league baseball
     players and the player's performance.  We use graphical
     methods to show relationships between a player's salary
     to his 1986 and career performance statistics  and  the
     player's team.

     Description of the 1988 Graphics Section Data Set

     The data consist of three files consisting of  data  on
the regular and leading substitute hitters in 1986, the reg-
ular pitchers in 1986 and the team statistics.   The  salary
data  were  taken  from  Sports Illustrated, April 20, 1987.
The salary of any player not included  in  that  article  is
listed  as an NA.  The 1986 and career statistics were taken
from The 1987 Baseball Encyclopedia Update published by Col-
lier  Books,  Macmillan  Publishing  Company, New York.  The
team attendance figures were obtained from the Elias  Sports
Bureau, personal conversation.

     The goal is to use  graphical  methods  to  attempt  to
explain differences in the salaries of major league baseball
players and to answer the question "Are players paid accord-
ing to their performance?".
